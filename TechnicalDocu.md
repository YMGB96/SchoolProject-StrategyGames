# **Technical Documentation**
**Technical details** like interfaces and important variables will be explained in this technical documentation

## **Tests**
Tests are there to ensure that all nessecary logic still works correctly so a developer can quickly see the effects of their changes

### **Starting the Tests**
To run the tests, you first need to `cd` into the package directory using:
```bash
cd board_blitz
```
Then you can start the tests by running:
```bash
python -m unittest tests
```
For subsequent runs of the tests, you don't need to `cd` again since you are allready in the correct folder

### **Adding a Test**
1. Create a file called `test_<filename>.py`
2. In that file, import the test framework using:
    ```py
    import unittest
    ```
3. Create a class for each endpoint you want to test (each function/method that you want to test), call it `Test<FunctionName>` and have it extend `unittest.TestCase` so it is seen as a test case by the framework
    ```py
    class TestMyFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    ```
4. Now you can set up the different ways this function should be tested by creating methods, that are called `test_<thing_to_test>`
    ```py
    def test_first_error(self):
    ```
5. To test if your function gives the correct output, you can use the [assetion methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods) provided by the framework
6. Finally, go into the [`/tests/__init__`](board_blitz/tests/__init__.py) file and import your classes:
    ```py
    from tests.test_my_file import *
    ```
You can look at [this file](board_blitz/tests/test_menu_logic.py) for an example

### **Mocking a Function call**
You might be **calling a function** that you don't want to test the functionality of or that you need a **specific output** from, then you can redirect or change that function call in your tests

First, import `patch` from the `unittest.mock` module:
```py
from unittest.mock import patch
```

Use the `setUpClass` classmethod to start a mock and make sure to stop it in the `tearDownClass` classmethod
```py
@classmethod
def setUpClass(cls):
    cls.mock_do_something = patch('database.do_something')
    cls.mock_do_something.start().return_value = True

@classmethod
def tearDownClass(cls):
    cls.mock_do_something.stop()
```

## **Menu Logic**
Contains a class that handles the logic of everything **outside of the game**, from registration and login to the leaderboard

### **How to use**
To talk to any part of the menu logic, you can import it the variable `menu_logic` of type `MenuLogic` using the following line:
```py
from menu_logic import menu_logic
```

### **Variables of Note**
To store the active **user**, **game** that is to be played and the ais **difficulty**, the fields `active_user`, `active_game` and `active_difficulty` are used

The file also has the **global variable** `menu_logic`, that is an **instance** of the featured `MenuLogic` **class**, so that other modules can easily access the **same instance**

### **Database**
In the file `database.py` a database named `'gamesdb.db'` is created to connect with the `SQLite3` module, two tables follow to store the login information of the registered users and to store the result values after every game finishes.

Following, some methods are defined to `add` entries to the database and to `fetch` contents from it, this methods can be called from other classes in the application.

### **Registering a User**
Use the `register` method, to register a user and set them as the active user

If there is any error, the method returns a string (`str`) containing an error message, an empty string otherwise
```py
err: str = menu_logic.register("username", "password", "password")
if err:
    print("An Error has occured:")
    print(err)
else:
    print("No Error has occured")
```

### **Logging in as a User**
Use the `login` method to check the account's details and set that user as the active one

If there is any error, the method returns a string (`str`) containing an error message, an empty string otherwise

```py
err: str = menu_logic.login("username", "password")
if err:
    print("An Error has occured:")
    print(err)
else:
    print("No Error has occured")
```

### **Hashing Passwords**
When registering a user, the `salt` is set to a random sequence of bytes

The entered plain text `password` then gets encoded into bytes, added onto the salt and **hashed using SHA-256**

Both the `salt` and the combined, hashed `password` get stored as hex strings in the database

When loggin in, and the username is matching, the plain text `password` the user typed in and the `salt` form the database get added onto one another and hashed

If the **resulting hash matches the hashed `password` from the database**, the user is logged in

Because of the `salt`, even passwords that are the same, won't look the same in the database, **increasing security**

### **Logging out**
To log out a user, you can call the `logout` method, it just resets the active user
```py
menu_logic.logout()
```

### **Get a sorted Leaderboard**
To get a sorted leaderboard, you can use the `get_leaderboard` method and pass in a field to sort by and if the sorting should be reversed or not
```py
sorted_leaderboard: list[dict] = menu_logic.get_leaderboard("name", False)
```

### **Start the Game**
To start the game, you first need to set the game type using the method `set_game` and the diffuculty using the method `set_difficulty`

Then you can start the game using `start_game`
```py
menu_logic.set_game(1)
menu_logic.set_difficulty(2)
menu_logic.start_game()
```

## **Game GUI**
Contains a class that displays the game and handles the user's input

It also contains a sprite class, that is an abstration on a clickable image or text with a background

You can find it [here](board_blitz/game_gui.py)

### **Constructor**
In it's `__init__` method, most of the object's fields get set, according to the optional `width` and `height` parameters where applicable

It also takes a `difficulty` and a `playername` as arguments so that it can display the correct names

### **Rendering**
The main module calls this method, it decides what to render and get's all the information needed for that from the game logic

### **Ending the Game**
Calling this method sets the object's fields, so that the game finished screen is shown

The parameter determines if the game counts as won or lost

### **Other Methods**
The following methods assist in rendering parts of the game

#### **Drawing the Board**
This method draws the given board and handles clicks on pieces

The only parameter is the board it will draw

When the mouse started getting pressed on this frame while hovering over any field of the 6x6 grid, the `selected_piece` changes to that field

#### **Overlay on Finished Game**
Once the game is finished, this method is used to display an overlay, darkening the screen and showing the result

#### **Drawing Names and Captures**
Names get drawn onto the screen according to the fields set in the constructor

The method also takes in the amount of captures and displays them above/below the names

#### **Drawing Rules**
Displays the rules according to the provided game type

The Rules are only shows while the game is paused


## **Game Logic**
Contains a class that handles the logic for both games.

### **Variables of Note**
The logic stores whether it currently is the **users turn**, the **user id**, which **game** is being played, the **board** state and whether or not a player is currently doing **consecutive moves** in checkers in the fields `player_turn` `user` `game` `difficulty` `board` and `consecutive move` respectively.

The logic also stores an **instance** of itself as a **global variable** in the `game_logic` field, to ensure that other modules access the same **instance**.

### **Starting a game**
Use the `start` method to start a new game. This method requires arguments for which **user** is playing, which **game** is to be played and the chosen **difficulty**
The method then sets the **board**, fetches the correct **username** from the database and instanciates both the **game gui** and the **ai**, sending the necessary information.
